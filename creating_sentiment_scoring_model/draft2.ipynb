Other cases either cover the artwork completely or are made of hard plastic which could actually damage the 3DS that it's supposed to protect.\\n\\nThis case is the best of both worlds - it's clear so I can see the awesome design but it's flexible and slightly soft so it doesn't damage the system. The fit on the system is absolutely perfect, it's easy to take on and off and has never gotten loose or warped. I've been using this case for a few months and it still looks brand new (as does my 3DS XL). It doesn't collect fingerprints or dust and it just feels nice to hold. It's smooth but gives a little grip. It's absolutely perfect!! Don't hesitate to get this one.   \n",

              "515   Bungie has decided to go down the path of app games for mobile phones. You are getting such a little bang for your buck, but don't worry: you'll be able to add to this short-termed game by buying more and more DLC! It's a game that you'll embrace if you like playing long enough to get new guns and to fight the same villains in the same situations again and again and again. If not, wait until it's half-price. Then you'll feel like you're getting your money's worth. It was such an amazing disappointment.\\n\\nUPDATE: And now I bumped it down to a 1-star rating. Even though I gave Bungie $60 to own this game, apparently I'm merely renting it. Right now I am no longer allowed to play the game because they have \"lost connection to partner services.\" I'm sure that Bungie wants to blame the PSN and the PSN wants to blame Bungie. In the end, the players are being told, \"Sorry, but tonight you can't play the game you purchased. Maybe tomorrow. We'll have to think about it. In the meantime, enjoy the plastic case we gave you!\"   \n",

It's a game that you'll embrace if you like playing long enough to get new guns and to fight the same villains in the same situations again and again and again. If not, wait until it's half-price. Then you'll feel like you're getting your money's worth. It was such an amazing disappointment.\\n\\nUPDATE: And now I bumped it down to a 1-star rating. Even though I gave Bungie $60 to own this game, apparently I'm merely renting it. Right now I am no longer allowed to play the game because they have \"lost connection to partner services.\" I'm sure that Bungie wants to blame the PSN and the PSN wants to blame Bungie.

I had the px21 headset and I absolutely loved it and they blew this headset away.  If I got a wireless headset that would perform as well as px21 Id have been happy.  So theres very low max volume, no bass whatsoever, and lastly when the sounds get very sublte, the headset shuts off  and on to save energy until constant sounds come back to if your in a black ops lobby and the music gets subtle u hear intermittent silence of the headset going off while the music gets subtle.  Its absolutely HOrrible!!!!!  Cant beleive a company like turtle beach would release this thing under their brand and am amazed other ppl rated them high.  I Effing hate this headset!!!!1   \n",

              "2416  This is an interesting idea but it could be better. I tried it on Windows 8.1. The product itself seems well made and sturdy enough. It could be more comfortable; perhaps softer material. The bracelet locking mechanism could be made easier and/or better instead being the usb plug. The bracelet itself could be made thinner. So in my opinion there are many possible improvements to be made that would be welcomed.\\n\\nI got the Small version which is roughly ~2.5 inches wide. Setup was easy; though it sure went through alot of updates. I plugged in the device and Windows installed the drivers. Then i opened the program and it made me register an account with them; which i believe is for their cloud backups of our games. After registering it had me update the gameband device which took less than a minute. I registered a new account; the gameband doesn't come with a licensed version of the game.  After i logged into my minecraft account and it took another couple minutes to update minecraft.\\n\\nA couple thoughts on the pixel display. It is not very clear out in sunlight. The pixel editor program could be alot better. It needs a nicer user interface and be simpler to use. The pixel display itself should have more options as well. I would like it to always be on for example; not just on a button press; which by the way is a badly design little button to have to press.   \n",

But the main and only two problems are the constant disconnects and  half the video screen which is barbled (or tearing) on my laptop. Now I have two systems one is an alienware with a nvidia card and the laptop a dell xps with a ati mobility. I  made sure everything is upgraded and tweak too work with most games. But  there is nothing I can do if COV is having compatibilty issues with the ati mobility card as stated in their website (still being worked on). The tech support technician states that the problem is with my system and and ISP. I play other online games and I will definitly know if there is a problem with my ISP (not) so I decided it is best to cancel my subscription since I cannot enjoy the game and have next to nil on getting any help from tech support. I do not know what high end system is needed or what else must be tweaked. All I can say COV is a nice concept and nice graphics but I guess it all depends on what high end PC system you are using. I wish you better luck in enjoying the game.   \n",

So theres very low max volume, no bass whatsoever, and lastly when the sounds get very sublte, the headset shuts off  and on to save energy until constant sounds come back to if your in a black ops lobby and the music gets subtle u hear intermittent silence of the headset going off while the music gets subtle.

It could be more comfortable; perhaps softer material. The bracelet locking mechanism could be made easier and/or better instead being the usb plug. The bracelet itself could be made thinner. So in my opinion there are many possible improvements to be made that would be welcomed.\\n\\nI got the Small version which is roughly ~2.5 inches wide. Setup was easy; though it sure went through alot of updates. I plugged in the device and Windows installed the drivers. Then i opened the program and it made me register an account with them; which i believe is for their cloud backups of our games. After registering it had me update the gameband device which took less than a minute. I registered a new account; the gameband doesn't come with a licensed version of the game.  After i logged into my minecraft account and it took another couple minutes to update minecraft.\\n\\nA couple thoughts on the pixel display. It is not very clear out in sunlight. The pixel editor program could be alot better. It needs a nicer user interface and be simpler to use. The pixel display itself should have more options as well. I would like it to always be on for example; not just on a button press; which by the way is a badly design little button to have to press.</td>\n",

But the main and only two problems are the constant disconnects and  half the video screen which is barbled (or tearing) on my laptop. Now I have two systems one is an alienware with a nvidia card and the laptop a dell xps with a ati mobility. I  made sure everything is upgraded and tweak too work with most games. But  there is nothing I can do if COV is having compatibilty issues with the ati mobility card as stated in their website (still being worked on). The tech support technician states that the problem is with my system and and ISP. I play other online games and I will definitly know if there is a problem with my ISP (not) so I decided it is best to cancel my subscription since I cannot enjoy the game and have next to nil on getting any help from tech support. I do not know what high end system is needed or what else must be tweaked. All I can say COV is a nice concept and nice graphics but I guess it all depends on what high end PC system you are using. I wish you better luck in enjoying the game.</td>\n",
