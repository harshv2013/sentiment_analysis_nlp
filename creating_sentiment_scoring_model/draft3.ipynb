              "      <td>Let me start by stating that I do not write reviews often and typically only do so when a product falls at either end of the 5 star spectrum. I have been playing this game since it was released in September and it has been the most problematic game I have ever played.\\n\\nI understand that games tend to have bugs and defects, and updates tend to fix that. However, there has never been a game like Civilization V that has produced bugs so horrendous that I can no longer enjoy the game. I have also been playing Fallout: New Vegas, which suffers from numerous bugs, but does not render the game unplayable. Yes, at times a glitch will keep you from advancing properly, but that can be easily resolved by saving and reloading frequently. While this can be tedious, at least it is an option.\\n\\nIn Civilization V, saving and reloading doesn't quite help. This game can be enjoyed in quick sessions with different victory styles, map sizes, and number of opponents. Unfortunately, the ideal settings limit the options; domination victory in a huge map with a large number of opponents is practically impossible (I'll go into the details in a moment). Prior to the first update, capturing the 69/70th city would crash the game. Attempting to reload a save with this number of cities was also impossible. This continued until the second update, which resolved the issue. However, this second update kept older save files from being loadable. You either had to have the 2K fellows \"fix\" your save file by posting it on the forums, or start all over again (I chose the latter).\\n\\nIf you prefer the domination victory, as you progress, the game will become less and less playable. The larger territory you have, the more prone the game is to crashing. The larger number of turns you have, the more prone the game is to crashing. Crashing isn't resolved by setting the graphics to the lowest possible setting or the use of DirectX 9 (which actually makes the crashes worse and more frequent on my computer). Sure, you save frequently to play it safe from these constant crashes... But it takes 10-15 minutes to load a saved game, which can also crash mid-load. So you waste half an hour loading a game you can play for 10 minutes before crashing. Currently, I cannot get past Turn 778, nor can I load a save with Turn 778. Even if this is fixed in the future, it ruins the game. Why should I have to worry constantly about the game failing to continue based on some number of cities or turns defect?\\n\\nYes, I understand that not everyone plays by the aforementioned playing style... However, if a company chooses to make the option available, it should be playable. If this game was not designed for huge maps, then don't include them. If long, drawn out games cause the game to crash, then don't include that option.\\n\\nGameplay: This is the only redeeming quality of a defective game. The gameplay is enjoyable and I like the new tile set-up and the unit to unit combat. Of course, this is as long as you don't mind idiotic AI. Yes, I will trade some Ivory with your country... BAM! Three turns later, they're declaring war on you, making the trade defunct. Yes, Bismarck is a jerk and a threat to the stability of the world, let's do what we can. BAM! They sign an open boarders agreement with the tyrant, who then marches his troops through their territory into yours to declare war. GREAT.\\n\\nCity-States: Good concept, worthless in game. The amount of money and time it takes to develop a lasting relationship with a City-State is far too costly. The cost do not outweigh the benefits an independent City-State gives you over time. The best thing to do is just take them over or leave them alone, the former causes everyone in the world to view you as power hungry and start attacking you.\\n\\nGraphics: Fantastic, if they load properly. I have the constant problem of farm tiles missing the \"farm\" texture as well as square pieces of land appearing in the middle of the ocean. Ghost enemy units pop up every now and then, and I have to constantly double check to make sure I'm actually attacking something. If you're trying to keep up with your resources, good luck, as the yield icons tend to be wrong 40% of the time. I just built a farm and the map tells me it is producing 4 Production and 3 Gold, but mousing over it shows 3 Food and 1 Production. Some areas are correct, but then others are offset by 1 tile in any direction. If you have a beast computer, you'll still experience a lot of graphical problems. I'm running a 3.2 Quad Core, 1 GB Radeon HD5770, 8 GB RAM... The graphics can be quite stunning at times and the unit close-ups are amazingly detailed. However, slow loading tiles often cause the game to crash, especially when the map skips from one unit to another across the world.\\n\\nThis game can be great. It can be amazing if you limit your gameplay style and if you're willing to constantly be fighting the game itself. I've been playing Civilization since Civilization III and I will say now, that this will be the last Civilization game I will buy/play. I can't imagine the headache the next game will become given the exponential increase in problems from Civilization IV (my favorite game thus far).\\n\\nBuy this game if you don't mind the trouble. It's a lemon.\\n\\nUPDATE (11/03/21): I continue to play this game, regardless of the troublesome errors that still occur. Even after the latest and greatest patch a few weeks ago, the game continues to crash on Huge and Large maps. This typically occurs when the map moves from one unit to another and spans a long distance. Typically, when it loads the tiles, this can cause hang ups with your system. I consider my computer relatively \"awesome\" and it still has problems, even at the lowest settings. As a precaution, you can \"preload\" tiles by scrolling over the entire map to the unit... Which doesn't make the game very enjoyable.\\n\\nAdditional quirks include the game crashing if a group of Civs decide to declare war on another Civ, but you happen to kill one of them or be at war with one of them. Specifically, in one game, I was at war with Alexander and at turn 452 he (along with Wu Zetian, Gandhi, Genghis Khan, and Elizabeth) were going to declare war on Bismarck (I have no idea why, since he only had three cities). If I conquered his Civilization at turn 451, the game would crash at 452. If I was still at war with him, but hadn't conquered him yet, the game would crash also. The solution (after several attempts) was to make peace at 451, then re-declare war via Nuclear Missile at turn 453, surpassing the unusual bug that crashed the game at turn 452. You can see the problem here, a game that is designed to have massive proportions of \"choice\" will have equally as massive of \"bugs.\" While Civilization IV was an amazing game that had fewer issues, this is not that game.\\n\\nI've come to the conclusion this game will never be \"perfect.\" Is it worth buying? Sure, if you're crazy enough to suffer through some weird issues here and there. Maybe on sale.</td>\n",

              "683   Let me start by stating that I do not write reviews often and typically only do so when a product falls at either end of the 5 star spectrum. I have been playing this game since it was released in September and it has been the most problematic game I have ever played.\\n\\nI understand that games tend to have bugs and defects, and updates tend to fix that. However, there has never been a game like Civilization V that has produced bugs so horrendous that I can no longer enjoy the game. I have also been playing Fallout: New Vegas, which suffers from numerous bugs, but does not render the game unplayable. Yes, at times a glitch will keep you from advancing properly, but that can be easily resolved by saving and reloading frequently. While this can be tedious, at least it is an option.\\n\\nIn Civilization V, saving and reloading doesn't quite help. This game can be enjoyed in quick sessions with different victory styles, map sizes, and number of opponents. Unfortunately, the ideal settings limit the options; domination victory in a huge map with a large number of opponents is practically impossible (I'll go into the details in a moment). Prior to the first update, capturing the 69/70th city would crash the game. Attempting to reload a save with this number of cities was also impossible. This continued until the second update, which resolved the issue. However, this second update kept older save files from being loadable. You either had to have the 2K fellows \"fix\" your save file by posting it on the forums, or start all over again (I chose the latter).\\n\\nIf you prefer the domination victory, as you progress, the game will become less and less playable. The larger territory you have, the more prone the game is to crashing. The larger number of turns you have, the more prone the game is to crashing. Crashing isn't resolved by setting the graphics to the lowest possible setting or the use of DirectX 9 (which actually makes the crashes worse and more frequent on my computer). Sure, you save frequently to play it safe from these constant crashes... But it takes 10-15 minutes to load a saved game, which can also crash mid-load. So you waste half an hour loading a game you can play for 10 minutes before crashing. Currently, I cannot get past Turn 778, nor can I load a save with Turn 778. Even if this is fixed in the future, it ruins the game. Why should I have to worry constantly about the game failing to continue based on some number of cities or turns defect?\\n\\nYes, I understand that not everyone plays by the aforementioned playing style... However, if a company chooses to make the option available, it should be playable. If this game was not designed for huge maps, then don't include them. If long, drawn out games cause the game to crash, then don't include that option.\\n\\nGameplay: This is the only redeeming quality of a defective game. The gameplay is enjoyable and I like the new tile set-up and the unit to unit combat. Of course, this is as long as you don't mind idiotic AI. Yes, I will trade some Ivory with your country... BAM! Three turns later, they're declaring war on you, making the trade defunct. Yes, Bismarck is a jerk and a threat to the stability of the world, let's do what we can. BAM! They sign an open boarders agreement with the tyrant, who then marches his troops through their territory into yours to declare war. GREAT.\\n\\nCity-States: Good concept, worthless in game. The amount of money and time it takes to develop a lasting relationship with a City-State is far too costly. The cost do not outweigh the benefits an independent City-State gives you over time. The best thing to do is just take them over or leave them alone, the former causes everyone in the world to view you as power hungry and start attacking you.\\n\\nGraphics: Fantastic, if they load properly. I have the constant problem of farm tiles missing the \"farm\" texture as well as square pieces of land appearing in the middle of the ocean. Ghost enemy units pop up every now and then, and I have to constantly double check to make sure I'm actually attacking something. If you're trying to keep up with your resources, good luck, as the yield icons tend to be wrong 40% of the time. I just built a farm and the map tells me it is producing 4 Production and 3 Gold, but mousing over it shows 3 Food and 1 Production. Some areas are correct, but then others are offset by 1 tile in any direction. If you have a beast computer, you'll still experience a lot of graphical problems. I'm running a 3.2 Quad Core, 1 GB Radeon HD5770, 8 GB RAM... The graphics can be quite stunning at times and the unit close-ups are amazingly detailed. However, slow loading tiles often cause the game to crash, especially when the map skips from one unit to another across the world.\\n\\nThis game can be great. It can be amazing if you limit your gameplay style and if you're willing to constantly be fighting the game itself. I've been playing Civilization since Civilization III and I will say now, that this will be the last Civilization game I will buy/play. I can't imagine the headache the next game will become given the exponential increase in problems from Civilization IV (my favorite game thus far).\\n\\nBuy this game if you don't mind the trouble. It's a lemon.\\n\\nUPDATE (11/03/21): I continue to play this game, regardless of the troublesome errors that still occur. Even after the latest and greatest patch a few weeks ago, the game continues to crash on Huge and Large maps. This typically occurs when the map moves from one unit to another and spans a long distance. Typically, when it loads the tiles, this can cause hang ups with your system. I consider my computer relatively \"awesome\" and it still has problems, even at the lowest settings. As a precaution, you can \"preload\" tiles by scrolling over the entire map to the unit... Which doesn't make the game very enjoyable.\\n\\nAdditional quirks include the game crashing if a group of Civs decide to declare war on another Civ, but you happen to kill one of them or be at war with one of them. Specifically, in one game, I was at war with Alexander and at turn 452 he (along with Wu Zetian, Gandhi, Genghis Khan, and Elizabeth) were going to declare war on Bismarck (I have no idea why, since he only had three cities). If I conquered his Civilization at turn 451, the game would crash at 452. If I was still at war with him, but hadn't conquered him yet, the game would crash also. The solution (after several attempts) was to make peace at 451, then re-declare war via Nuclear Missile at turn 453, surpassing the unusual bug that crashed the game at turn 452. You can see the problem here, a game that is designed to have massive proportions of \"choice\" will have equally as massive of \"bugs.\" While Civilization IV was an amazing game that had fewer issues, this is not that game.\\n\\nI've come to the conclusion this game will never be \"perfect.\" Is it worth buying? Sure, if you're crazy enough to suffer through some weird issues here and there. Maybe on sale.   \n",

                 I have played every version of half-life there is. If you haven't orange box throws them in the box (play them 1st!). Nice mix of puzzles and first person shooter and a complex and interesting story. Plays well on Vista.   \n",
