              "2294  Just to let the viewers know, I have a \"Xbox\". After playing the first KOTOR. Which was excellent. I was expecting this one to be the same or even better. They did not finish takening out the bugs and finishing with the final touch ups. It keeps locking up when you use the Workbenches ( for upgrades) on the planet Peragus. Also it would skip certain movies. So I finally took mine back to the store and exchanged with a newer/updated one. It still had problems, but enough that I could finish the story. You can see they were too much in a hurry to have it released on time (very big mistake). FYI: Next time if it is not ready for release then wait til it is. You really disappointed many Star Wars Fans. I have been a fan since the 70's.   \n",

Also it would skip certain movies. So I finally took mine back to the store and exchanged with a newer/updated one. It still had problems, but enough that I could finish the story. You can see they were too much in a hurry to have it released on time (very big mistake). FYI: Next time if it is not ready for release then wait til it is.

I remember Apple computer released a game in the 80s that had a manager mode that had GRAPHICS. And today's game makers can't achieve this?\\n\\nGraphics average. Pitching is fairly accurate... when your pitcher gets tired or rattled, the aim gets shakey and harder to hit your mark... I like that. This also allows for pitches to be balls, which leads to the \"ever so rare\" BASE ON BALLS.\\n\\nHitting is done by pulling back on the R3 stick and releasing to swing. You can't aim WHERE to swing. Ultimately, it's too easy.\\n\\nAlso, controls, at times, are WAY TOO CONFUSING. I was batting one time, bumped something ???? and my RIGHT HANDED batter switched to a LEFTY!!??\\n\\nThis game is a mess.

              "154   Ordered the digital code.  I keep getting this message when I enter the code: \" The code you entered may not be correct or may no longer be valid. Please check your entry.\"  Amazon says I need to contact Sony.  Sony phone says wait is 40 minutes and recommends using online chat.  Every few minutes Sony chat updates the screen with \"Verification expired. Check the checkbox again.\" followed by the message \"Cannot contact reCAPTCHA. Check your connection and try again.\"  There is absolutely no problem with my connection!  Meanwhile my grandson is expecting to be able to play this game tomorrow and right now it seems like I'll have to kiss this $21.44 goodbye and purchase this item again from a brick-and-mortar store.\\n\\nUPDATE:  Before shutting down my computer for the night I checked my email and found a message from Sony thanking me for my purchase.  I checked my download library and found \"Need for Speed\" was already there -- even though I never was able to enter the code.  Not sure I like how that happened, and it would have been nice if instead of the invalid code message they would have informed me that it was already in my library.  Anyway, it is downloading now and hopefully my grandson will be happy when he sees it on his PS4 tomorrow.\\n\\nUPDATE 2:  My grandson continues to have connection problems with EA and NFS servers, both at startup and with run-time network errors.  He is downstairs crying now because 1) just after he bought a car he was kicked off with a network error, 2) he just tried repeatedly for more than half an hour to get back on, and 3) when he got back on the car he purchased was gone along with the money he used to purchase it.  Between his experience with this game and GW2 he is disgusted with EA.   \n",

Please check your entry.\"  Amazon says I need to contact Sony.  Sony phone says wait is 40 minutes and recommends using online chat.  Every few minutes Sony chat updates the screen with \"Verification expired. Check the checkbox again.\" followed by the message \"Cannot contact reCAPTCHA. Check your connection and try again.\"  There is absolutely no problem with my connection!  Meanwhile my grandson is expecting to be able to play this game tomorrow and right now it seems like I'll have to kiss this $21.44 goodbye and purchase this item again from a brick-and-mortar store.\\n\\nUPDATE:  Before shutting down my computer for the night I checked my email and found a message from Sony thanking me for my purchase.  I checked my download library and found \"Need for Speed\" was already there -- even though I never was able to enter the code.  Not sure I like how that happened, and it would have been nice if instead of the invalid code message they would have informed me that it was already in my library.  Anyway, it is downloading now and hopefully my grandson will be happy when he sees it on his PS4 tomorrow.\\n\\nUPDATE 2:  My grandson continues to have connection problems with EA and NFS servers, both at startup and with run-time network errors.  He is downstairs crying now because 1) just after he bought a car he was kicked off with a network error, 2) he just tried repeatedly for more than half an hour to get back on, and 3) when he got back on the car he purchased was gone along with the money he used to purchase it.  Between his experience with this game and GW2 he is disgusted with EA.</td>\n",

I currently own an FK1+, EC1A, Logitech G403 Wireless, Nixeus Revel, HyperX Pulsefire FPS, and Pluggable 3360 mouse.  Unfortunately within a month the middle scroll button from the White EC2A started to fail with inconsistent clicks and getting stuck.\\n\\nI applied for an RMA with Zowie direct which took about Two weeks and reaching out to their social channels for a response.  Totally disappointing initial service.\\n\\nFortunately the replacement took three days total for a replacement, much faster than a response which helped ease the frustration of the service. A product is only as good as the provided service for a whole experience.\\n\\nLet's see how the replacement turns out.  Rexflo: A+, Zowie Support Intial Response: F-, Zowie RMA: A+   \n",
